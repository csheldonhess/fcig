Code4Lib Community Vote on Fiscal Continuity Options
====================================================

The purpose of this vote is to determine the will of the Code4Lib community, as it relates to ongoing fiscal continuity of our annual conferences, journal, and other undertakings. The options referenced in this ballot are detailed here: https://wiki.code4lib.org/FCIG_Report, and the questions below assume that you are familiar with the entirety of the report.

Method of Voting
----------------
This ballot uses score voting, which allows for awarding scores to each choice on the ballot to reflect the strength of voters’ preferences among all available options. More info on the rationale for score voting is available here: https://electology.org/score-voting

Ballot Instructions
-------------------
For each item in the ballot questions below, choose the score you wish to assign from 0-3.

0 = least favored; 3 = most favored; so, when votes are tallied, the items with the highest point totals overall win the vote. 

You may assign scores to as many items as you like, and items’ scores are independent of one another (i.e., multiple items may be given the same score).

Any Questions about this Process? Ask them on the C4L List! 
-----------------------------------------------------------
This voting period is a time for open discussion, debate, and community analysis of the information presented in the FCIG Report. If you have any questions about the FCIG report, this ballot, or any of the options provided, ask your questions on the Code4Lib listserv so that the community can discuss them and so that previous conference volunteers, FCIG members, and potential fiscal sponsors can provide more details as needed.

Ballot Questions : Please vote on both questions below
----------------

### Question 1

In this community vote, the FCIG asks C4L to evaluate the data presented in the FCIG Report, and to choose among the three options for moving forward that the Report outlines: 
* do nothing/maintain status quo 
* obtain an ongoing fiscal sponsorship with an organization external to Code 4 Lib 
* seek out official status for C4L as an independent, non-profit organization. 

**Please express your preference among these three options.** Rate each of the options below (a,b,c) in terms of how well you believe they will help Code4Lib meet its goals:

    a) Do nothing/Maintain status quo: Local Conference Planning Committees bear burden of finding and recruiting a local “fiscal host” for conference each year (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

    b) Secure an ongoing fiscal sponsorship for C4L: pursue one of the offers from possible fiscal sponsors outlined in the FCIG Report  (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

    c) Incorporate C4L as a nonprofit entity  (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

### Question 2
Relative to the option of obtaining ongoing fiscal sponsorship from an organization external to Code4Lib (option b, in Question 1 above), the FCIG Report presents possible sponsorship terms that have been offered by four different external organizations. If the community as a whole chooses to go with this option, how would you rank your preferences as far as the terms offered by each organization?

**Please assign a rank for each of the organizations below, according to your assessment of the terms offered by that organization.** *Note: If the Code4Lib community instead chooses to maintain the status quo (option a, in Question 1 above) or to incorporate as a nonprofit entity (option c, in Question 1 above), the results of this question will be ignored.*

    a) ALA/LITA  (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

    b) DLF/CLIR  (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

    c) Open Library Federation (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)
    
    d) DuraSpace  (assign rating: 0, 1, 2, or 3)
